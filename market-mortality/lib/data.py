	#	2012 Gross Domestic Product by County Cluster (2012 $US Million)
	#	Data preparation:
	#		States touched by at least one county within the 'county cluster' set:
	#			MW: IA, IL, IN, KS, KY, MI, MN, MO, OH, PA, SD, WI, WV
	#			CA: CA
	#		Total BEA GDP for the set of states was calculated in acp/clusters/gdp/gdp_compare.xlsx
	#		BEA cluster-states GDP was then distributed by cluster region and rest_of_region using 2012 county-level IMPLAN data given in the csv files in acp/clusters/gdp
	#		regional 2012 IMPLAN data was prepared in the acp/implanRead repository by acp_base_data.py
	#		state cluster GDP is derived from the BEA data presented above
	#	Original data:
	#		Gross Domestic Product by State, 2008-2013 (millions of current dollars)
