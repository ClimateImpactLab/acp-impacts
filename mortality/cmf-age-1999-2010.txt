Caveats:
"1. Data for Denali Borough, Alaska (FIPS code 02068) are only available for 2003 and later; for computational purposes, counts"
"and population estimates for 1999-2002 are set to zero. Thus, counts and rates shown in multi-year requests for this entity do"
"not include any data for years prior to 2003, only data for 2003 and later. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Denali Borough."
"2. There is a discontinuity in the mortality and population data for Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area (FIPS code 02290) between 2002"
"and 2003. The discontinuity occurs because part of Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area became Denali Borough, Alaska (FIPS code 02068) and"
"beginning in 2003, deaths and population counts for this former part of Yukon-Koyukuk are reported for Denali Borough and are no"
"longer included with data for Yukon-Koyukuk."
"3. Death rates for Clifton Forge city, Virginia (FIPS code 51560) are available only for 1999-2000. For 2001 and beyond, death"
"counts and population estimates for Clifton Forge city have been combined with those for Alleghany county, Virginia (FIPS code"
"51005). Death counts and population estimates for this entity from multi-year requests, only reflect data from 1999 and 2000;"
"for 2001 and beyond they have been set to zero. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Clifton Forge."
"4. There is a discontinuity in the mortality and population data for Alleghany, Virginia (FIPS code 51005) between 2000 and"
"2001. It occurs because for 2001 and beyond, death counts and population estimates for Clifton Forge city, Virginia (FIPS code"
"51560) have been combined with those for Alleghany county."
"5. Data for Broomfield, Colorado (FIPS code 08014) are only available for 2003 and later; for computational purposes, counts and"
"population estimates for 1999-2002 are set to zero. Thus, counts and rates shown in multi-year requests for this entity do not"
"include any data for years prior to 2003, only data for 2003 and later. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Broomfield."
"6. There is a discontinuity in the mortality and population data for Adams, Colorado (FIPS code 08001), Boulder, Colorado (FIPS"
"code 08013), Jefferson, Colorado (FIPS code 08059), and Weld, Colorado (FIPS code 080123) between 2002 and 2003. This"
"discontinuity occurs because territory in each of these four counties has been combined to form a new county, Broomfield,"
"Colorado (FIPS code 08014). Beginning in 2003, deaths and population counts for this territory are reported for Broomfield"
"county and are no longer included with data for Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld."
"7. Deaths for Allen Parish, Louisiana (FIPS code 22003] in 2006 through 2008 are under reported due to problems with registering"
"the deaths with the Louisiana Vital Statistics Office."
"8. Deaths and population estimates are shown separately from the adjacent counties for Carson City, Nevada (FIPS code 32510)."
"9. Deaths and population estimates are reported separately for Baltimore City (FIPS code 24510) and Baltimore county (FIPS code"
"24005)."
"10. Deaths and population estimates are reported separately for St. Louis City (FIPS code 29510) and county (FIPS code 29189)."
"11. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the"
"resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"12. About sub-national population figures: population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 series of bridged-race intercensal"
"estimates of the July 1 resident population; population figures for 2000 and 2010 are bridged-race April 1 census counts; and"
"population figures for 2001-2009 are from the revised 2000-2009 series of bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1"
"resident population."
"13. Due to confidentiality constraints, sub-national death counts and rates are suppressed when the number of deaths is less"
"than 10. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"14. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"15. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age"
"groups, so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
